## Introduction

**jScroll** is a jQuery plugin for infinite scrolling, written by [Philip Klauzinski](https://philip.klauzinski.com). Infinite scrolling; also known as lazy loading, endless scrolling, autopager, endless pages, etc.; is the ability to load content via AJAX within the current page or content area as you scroll down. The new content can be loaded automatically each time you scroll to the end of the existing content, or it can be triggered to load by clicking a navigation link at the end of the existing content.

An example of infinite scrolling is your Facebook "News Feed" page. You may notice that when you scroll to the bottom of this page, new content will often load automatically, or you will be given a link to "Older Posts" which will load more content when clicked.
